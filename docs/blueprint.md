# **App Name**: ReasoningFlow

## Core Features:

- Pipeline Definition: Allow users to define a sequence of reasoning steps (the 'chain') using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface.
- LLM Execution: Execute the defined chain-of-thought using a Python backend to interact with the LLM. Use a tool so the LLM decides what information to use when generating text.
- Reasoning Capture: Capture each intermediate reasoning step generated by the LLM during execution.
- Visualization: Visualize the captured reasoning steps in a clear, step-by-step format on the frontend. Display information that may or may not have influenced the final answer.
- Data Storage: Store pipeline definitions and reasoning step data in a MySQL database.
- Execution History: Provide a history of previous pipeline executions, allowing users to review past reasoning processes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#6666FF), reflecting the app's analytical purpose with a hint of creativity. 
- Background color: Light Grayish-Indigo (#E0E0F8), maintaining a professional yet soft interface.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to ensure clear and readable text, consistent with a modern application style.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', a monospace font for any displayed code or structured data.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different reasoning steps and data elements.
- Implement subtle animations to highlight the flow of reasoning and interactive elements.
